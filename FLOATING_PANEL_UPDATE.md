## 🐛 Debugging

If the panel doesn't appear:

4. Try refreshing the page
5. Check if panel is already open (only one instance allowed)

## 🎉 Summary

The floating panel is now a complete, standalone interface that provides all the functionality of the extension popup directly on any webpage. Users can sign in, browse profiles, select profiles, view details, and trigger auto-fill without ever leaving the page they're working on.
